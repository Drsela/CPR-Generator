## Modulus 11 control
The logic of the application assumes that the modulus 11 control is valid, as seen in these docs: https://cpr.dk/media/12066/personnummeret-i-cpr.pdf

[Some CPR numbers doesn't adhere to the modulus 11 control](https://cpr.dk/cpr-systemet/personnumre-uden-kontrolciffer-modulus-11-kontrol) - these numbers will not be generated by this app
